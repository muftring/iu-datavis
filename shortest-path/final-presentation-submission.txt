Notes:
I had issues with slides that had audio and video elements.
In order to present both, I needed to duplicate slides and play just one on each.
This extended the total time of the video to almost 11 minutes.

The playback speed of the captured videos is eratic; I could not figure out how to resolve this.
Several online articles indicated there were no controls in PowerPoint to adjust this.
I am hoping the final material submitted with the report will present the D3 application
much better.
