I found a nice messy chart here:

Actualy there were several, but I chose to look at the "US Households' Balance Sheet" bar chart, which is originally from this blog:

The bar chart itself:

Problems:
(1) 
(2) 

Original data source:
https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/Z1/Current/default.htm

And the report used is the B.101 Balance Sheet of Households and Nonprofit Organizations (1)
https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/html/b101.htm

This site allows selection of the data items, which I needed to reverse engineer from the very summarized legends on the bar chart:

+ Net Worth -> Households and nonprofit organizations; net worth
+ Financial Assets -> Households and nonprofit organizations; total financial assets
+ Real Estate -> Households and nonprofit organizations; real estate at market value
+ Debt -> Households and nonprofit organizations; total liabilities

Observations:
(1) the Federal Reserve site allows you to select the data points you want
(2) it allows you to generate a graph, which happens to be a much more legible line chart
(3) it allows you to download the data in CSV format
